# ü¶ç banana-coding-style-checker üçå

The *Bot Analyzing Nomenclature And Nonsensical Arrangements* is a set of vera++ rules aimed at enforcing the [Epitech's C coding style](https://intra.epitech.eu/file/Public/technical-documentations/epitech_c_coding_style.pdf).

In order for it to work properly, **it needs to have all the files of the repository passed to it** (not only the C source and header files), so it can analyze them (the files are smartly ignored if some rules are not applicable to them).
